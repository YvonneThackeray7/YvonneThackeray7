## Hi there 👋

🔧 Hello everyone, 

I'm Nathan, and I’m currently a student majoring in Artificial Intelligence. 


🛠 My primary research interest lies in the field of AI Agents 

— intelligent systems capable of autonomous reasoning, planning, 

and interacting with their environment. 


✒️ I’m especially fascinated by how multi-agent collaboration, 

reinforcement learning, 

and large language models can be integrated to build more adaptive and human-aligned agents.


📕 During my studies, 

I’ve been exploring both the theoretical and practical aspects of agent architectures, 

such as goal-oriented reasoning, dialogue-based task execution, 

and tool-use integration. 

🔗 I enjoy combining programming with research, 

experimenting with frameworks that bring agents closer to real-world applications. 

In the future, 

I hope to contribute to developing agent systems that can act as reliable partners for humans in education, science, and creative work.
